- Dark color scheme: Background is a very dark gray (#121212) for a modern, sleek aesthetic.
- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) is used for primary interactive elements.
- Accent color: Electric green (#7CFC00) is used to highlight key actions and information.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for both headlines and body text, offering a clean and modern look.
- Use simple, outlined icons in electric green (#7CFC00) to represent actions and feedback.
- The layout should be clean and intuitive, with clear separation of the prompt input area, generation button, and test case display area.
- Use subtle animations and transitions to provide visual feedback during test case generation and when copying to the clipboard.
